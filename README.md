# R6 Chat Macro
This Chat Macro is made for Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, by default it will type 3 positive messages. It also has the ability to type custom messages. 

# Quick Start
1. Navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/grenade-inspector0/R6-Chat-Macro/releases)
2. Under the latest release download the file called, "R6_Chat_Macro.exe"
3. Run the .exe file, configure the config if you want, then start the .exe again.
4. Tab back into the game
5. Now when you're in a match, simply press your choosen hotkey (the default hotkey is F2, FN + 2 on <60% keyboards), then it will start typing.

# How does it work?
It works by randomly selecting 3 positive messages from a list of 35 messages (or selects 3 messages from a list of your custom messages), then types those messages in-game. All you need to do is set your hotkey within the config file (It's generated at the first startup; F2 by default), then tab into the game and press your selected hotkey.

# FAQ
- Will this get me banned?
  - No, as long as you're not spamming the chat, then you'll be fine.
- How often should I use the macro?
  - In order to get the most positive units per match for messages you need at least 3 positive messages. So, I'd recommend you press the macro at least once per game.
