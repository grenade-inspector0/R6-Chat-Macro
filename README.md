# R6 ReputationFarmer
This is a macro to boost your positive units within Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. You can either compile it from the python source code or use the pre-compiled exe. 

# How does it work?
It works by randomyl selecting 3 positive messages from a list of 35 messages, then types those messages in-game. All you need to do is set your hotkey within the config file (It's generated at the first startup; F2 by default), then tab into the game and press your selected hotkey.
